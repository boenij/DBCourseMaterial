This tutorial is for the Lecture 3 of the Data Modelling and Databases 
class [http://www.ds3lab.com/dmdb-2020/#lecture3]. 

#### Goal

In Lecture 3, we looked at a range of query languages, including
Relational Calculus, Relational Algebra, Conjunctive Query, and 
SQL. However, but just looking at the slides, it is hard to grasp
how a real-world database system actually works. This tutorial is
to facility our understanding of how DB interacts with the user
and other programs.

After this tutorial, you should be able to understand:
- How to *install* a DBMS in Ubuntu.
- How to *create* a DB using the DBMS we installed.
- How to *create* relations inside the DB we created.
- How to *interact* with the DB from other programs.
- How to *interact* with the DB from the built-in DBMS client.
- How to *bulk load and dump* data, and how to issue simple SQL queries.
